# cube-addict-tracker

Create an wishlist single page app to track my speedcube addiction. It should support: 

â€¢ Adding a cube should be as easy as pasting a link from speedcubeshop.com or thecubicle.com and it will automatically import the name, price, image, but also details such as size, features (maglev, core to corner magnets, magnets etc.)
â€¢ Sorting cubes
â€¢ Editing cubes
â€¢ Deleting cubes
